    <img src="./.asset/logo.color.svg" width="45" /> TaskWeaver
</h1>

A **code-first** agent framework for seamlessly planning and executing data analytics tasks. 
This innovative framework interprets user requests through coded snippets and efficiently 
coordinates a variety of plugins in the form of functions to execute 
data analytics tasks

**Highlighted Features**

- [x] **Rich data structure** - TaskWeaver allows you to work with rich data 
    structures in Python, such as DataFrames, instead of having to work with 
    text strings.
- [x] **Customized algorithms** - TaskWeaver allows you to encapsulate your 
    own algorithms into plugins (in the form of Python functions), 
    and orchestrate them to achieve complex tasks.
- [x] **Incorporating domain-specific knowledge** - TaskWeaver is designed to 
    be easily incorporating domain-specific knowledge, such as the knowledge 
    of execution flow, to improve the reliability of the AI copilot.
- [x] **Stateful conversation** - TaskWeaver is designed to support stateful 
    conversation. It can remember the context of the conversation and 
    leverage it to improve the user experience.
- [x] **Code verification** - TaskWeaver is designed to verify the generated code 
    before execution. It can detect potential issues in the generated code 
    and provide suggestions to fix them.
- [x] **Easy to use** - TaskWeaver is designed to be easy to use. 
    We provide a set of sample plugins and a tutorial to help you get started.
    Users can easily create their own plugins based on the sample plugins.
    TaskWeaver offers an open-box experience, allowing users to run a service immediately after installation.
- [x] **Easy to debug** - TaskWeaver is designed to be easy to debug. 
    We have detailed logs to help you understand what is going on during calling the LLM, 
    the code generation, and execution process.
- [x] **Security consideration** - TaskWeaver supports a basic session management to keep
    different users' data separate. The code execution is separated into different processes in order not to interfere with each other.
- [x] **Easy extension** - TaskWeaver is designed to be easily extended to accomplish 
    more complex tasks. You can create multiple AI copilots to
    act in different roles, and orchestrate them to achieve complex tasks.

# News

- [2023-12-12] A simple UI demo is available in playground/UI folder, try with the [README](/playground/UI/README.md)
- [2023-11-30] TaskWeaver is released on GitHubðŸŽˆ. 


# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or above
- OpenAI (or Azure OpenAI) access with GPT-3.5 above models. However, it is strongly recommended to use the GPT-4, which is more stable.
- Other requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. 

> OpenAI API had a major [update](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) from 0.xx to 1.xx in November 2023. 
> Please make sure you are not using an old version because the API is not backward compatible.


## Quick Start

### Installation
You can install TaskWeaver by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional] create a conda environment to isolate the dependencies
# conda create -n taskweaver python=3.10
# conda activate taskweaver

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver.git
cd TaskWeaver
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Project Directory
TaskWeaver runs as a process, you need to create a project directory to store plugins and configuration files. 
We provided a sample project directory in the `project` folder. You can copy the `project` folder to your workspace.
A project directory typically contains the following files and folders:

```bash
ðŸ“¦project
 â”£ ðŸ“œtaskweaver_config.json # the configuration file for TaskWeaver
 â”£ ðŸ“‚plugins # the folder to store plugins
 â”£ ðŸ“‚planner_examples # the folder to store planner examples
 â”£ ðŸ“‚codeinterpreter_examples # the folder to store code interpreter examples
 â”£ ðŸ“‚sample_data # the folder to store sample data used for evaluations
 â”£ ðŸ“‚logs # the folder to store logs, will be generated after program starts
 â”— ðŸ“‚workspace # the directory stores session dataï¼Œ will be generated after program starts
    â”— ðŸ“‚ session_id 
      â”£ ðŸ“‚ces # the folder used by the code execution service
      â”— ðŸ“‚cwd # the current working directory to run the generated code
```

### OpenAI Configuration
Before running TaskWeaver, you need to provide your OpenAI API key and other necessary information. 
You can do this by editing the `taskweaver_config.json` file. 
If you are using Azure OpenAI, you need to set the following parameters in the `taskweaver_config.json` file:
#### Azure OpenAI
```json
{
"llm.api_base": "https://xxx.openai.azure.com/",
"llm.api_key": "your_api_key",
"llm.api_type": "azure",
"llm.api_version": "the api version",
"llm.model": "the model name, e.g., gpt-4"
}
```

#### OpenAI
```json
{
"llm.api_key": "the api key",
"llm.model": "the model name, e.g., gpt-4"
}
```
>ðŸ’¡ Only the latest OpenAI API supports the `json_object` response format. 
> If you are using an older version of OpenAI API, you need to set the `llm.response_format` to `null`.

More configuration options can be found in the [configuration documentation](docs/configuration.md).

### Start TaskWeaver
```bash
# assume you are in the taskweaver folder
# -p is the path to the project directory
python -m taskweaver -p ./project/
```
This will start the TaskWeaver process and you can interact with it through the command line interface. 
If everything goes well, you will see the following prompt:

```
=========================================================

### Two Walkthrough Examples



#### Example 1: Pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm
In this example, we will show you how to use TaskWeaver to pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm.

[Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/assets/7489260/9f854acf-f2bf-4566-9d16-f84e915d0f4e)

If you want to follow this example, you need to configure the `sql_pull_data` plugin in the `project/plugins/sql_pull_data.yaml` file.
You need to provide the following information:
```yaml
api_type: azure or openai
api_base: ...
api_key: ...
api_version: ...
deployment_name: ...
sqlite_db_path: sqlite:///../../../sample_data/anomaly_detection.db
```
The `sql_pull_data` plugin is a plugin that pulls data from a database. It takes a natural language request as input and returns a DataFrame as output.

This plugin is implemented based on [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/).
If you want to follow this example, you need to install the Langchain package:
```bash
pip install langchain
pip install tabulate
```

#### Example 2: Forecast QQQ's price in the next week
In this example, we will show you how to use TaskWeaver to forecast QQQ's price in the next week using the ARIMA algorithm. 

[Nasdaq 100 Index Price Forecasting](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/assets/7489260/c2b09615-52d8-491f-bbbf-e86ba282e59a)

If you want to follow this example, you need to you have two requirements installed:
```bash
pip install yfinance
pip install statsmodels
```

For more examples, please refer to our [paper](http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2311.17541). 

> ðŸ’¡ The planning of TaskWeaver are based on the LLM model. Therefore, if you want to repeat the examples, the execution process may be different
> from what you see in the videos. Typically, more concrete prompts will help the model to generate better plans and code.

## How to use TaskWeaver in your project

### Using TaskWeaver as a library
After cloning the TaskWeaver repository, you can install TaskWeaver as a library by running the following command:
```bash
# clone the repository
cd TaskWeaver
pip install -e .
```
Then, you can follow the [documentation](docs/taskweaver_as_a_lib.md) to use TaskWeaver in your code.

### Using TaskWeaver as a service
TaskWeaver can be used as a service that can be called by other programs. More details are TBD.

## Customizing TaskWeaver

There are two ways to customize TaskWeaver: creating plugins and creating examples. 

### Creating Plugins

Since TaskWeaver can already perform some basic tasks, you can create plugins to extend its capabilities.
A plugin is a python function that takes a set of arguments and returns a set of results.

Typically, you only need to write a plugin in the following example scenarios:
- You want to encapsulate your own algorithm into a plugin.
- You want to import a python package that is not supported by TaskWeaver.
- You want to connect to an external data source to pull data.
- You want to query a web API.

Refer to the [plugin documentation](docs/plugin.md) for more details. Otherwise, you can leverage TaskWeaver's code generation capability to perform tasks.

### Creating Examples

The purpose of examples is to help LLMs understand how to perform tasks especially when 
the tasks are complex and need domain-specific knowledge.

There are two types of examples: (1) planning examples and (2) code interpreter examples.
Planning examples are used to demonstrate how to use TaskWeaver to plan for a specific task.
Code generation examples are used to demonstrate how to generate code or orchestrate plugins to perform a specific task.

Refer to the [example documentation](docs/example.md) for more details.
